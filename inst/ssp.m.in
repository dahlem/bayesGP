## Predictive error sum of squares using the cross validation errors
## from PHD thesis JD Martin equation 5.1
## X: the matrix with the design points used to fit the model
## y: the vector of responses from the experiment
## R: the correlation matrix of the input parameters
## theta: the estimated theta parameters from MLE or BA MCMC
## beta: the estimated beta parameters from MLE or BA MCMC
function press = ssp(X, y, R, beta, FUN = @(x) 1)
  e = cv_error(X, y, R, beta, FUN);
  press = sum(e.^2);
endfunction
